A man sets light to himself, promising his followers that he will rise again in three hours. 
When the time elapsed, the police clear away the remains. 

Another man, a half-caste, has himself crucified every year â€”

Eyez that have seen pain, worlds fallen apart
But one who is bold enough to take life punches
